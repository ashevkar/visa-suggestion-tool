# 💡 Natural Language → Visa Component Suggestion Tool

Welcome to an innovative developer-first experience built with the [Visa Product Design System (Nova)](https://developer.visa.com/pages/design-system) in mind.

This tool transforms natural language descriptions like _"Responsive login form with remember me"_ into:
- 🎯 **Accurate component suggestions** using Visa’s Nova library
- 🧩 **Instant code snippets** ready to plug into your project
- ⚡ **Developer-friendly UI** with accessibility and usability at its core

🛠 **Try it Live:** [🔗 Deployed on Vercel](https://your-vercel-link.com)  
📂 **Source Code:** [🔗 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ashevkar/visa-component-suggestion-tool)

## 🚀 Why This Tool?

Developers often know what they want to build—but translating ideas into specific UI components takes time.  
This app bridges that gap with a seamless, natural-language-to-code experience. It's quick, efficient, and fun to use!

## 🧪 How It Works

1. 🗣 Type a UI description (e.g., "Sign-up form with email & password fields")
2. 🔍 Get relevant visa design components (like `Input`, `Button`, `Card`)
3. 🧱 View the code snippet combining them into a usable UI
4. 📋 Click to copy, paste into your project, and go!

## 💭 Behind the Scenes

- Created a **rule-based matcher** using keyword parsing (e.g., “form”, “login”, “button”).
- Used **mocked Nova components** with matching class names to simulate Visa UI.
- Prioritized **clean layout** and fast workflow to support frontend developers.

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

With more time, here’s what I’d love to add:

- 🤖 **AI-powered NLP backend** to support fuzzy queries and better matching
- 📦 **Real Nova component integration** via API or live docs
- 🎥 **Live Preview Mode** for real-time rendered UI blocks
- 💾 **History & Favorites** to store your favorite prompts and snippets
- 🧩 **VSCode Extension** to bring this functionality right into your editor
